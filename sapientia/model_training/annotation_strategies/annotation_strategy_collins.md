# Collins - Annotation strategy 

This document summarizes the annotation strategy for Collins training data. 

## Named entities

We identified the following named entities : 

- ROLE
- DOCUMENT
- STANDARD
- COMPONENT
- HARDWARE
- SYSTEM
- PARAMETER
- CONDITION
- UNIT
- PROCESS
- EVENT
- PHASE
- LANGUAGE

### Role 

Roles are given to entities such as the _Supplier_, the _Provider_, or the _equipment manufacturer_, for example. 

### Document

Used to describe documents such as _technical reports_ or _technical specifications_.

### Standard

Standards are norms such as _DO-178C_ as well as requirements and criteria like _maintainability_ or _safety_.

### Component

A component is a hardware part such as _Electro-Mechanical Actuator_. 

### Hardware

_Aircraft_ is not a component, it's hardware.

### System

We also need to describe systems such as _flight control system_.

### Parameter

Internal variables and features such as _life time_, _coefficient degradation_. or _input power_, as well as external parameters such as _temperature_.

### Condition

Used to describe the state of a component or an operating condition, for example _active_, _true_, _in-flight_ or _open_.

### Unit

Units are used to precisely describe measures such as temperatures (_11째C_), distance (_3cm_) or voltage, for example.

### Process

Processes are operations such as _monitoring_, for example.

### Event

External events that alter a component or a system condition or parameter, typically _failures_, for example.

### Phase

Project phases such as _design_, _development_ or _rig tests_.

### Language

Natural languages such as _English_ or _French_.

## Relations

We identified the following relations : 

- COLLABORATION
- PROVIDE
- COMPLY_WITH
- COMPOSED_BY
- HAS_FEATURE
- HAS_VALUE
- CONTROL
- CONNECTION

The relations are directed, except for CONNECTION and COLLABORATION. We use the following notation : relation(named_entity_1, named_entity_2) to represent the relation from named_entity_1 to named_entity_2.

### Collaboration

_Collaboration_ is a relation existing between two roles. 

For example, the _Supplier_ **provides** technical requirements to the _Provider_.

COLLABORATION(Supplier, Provider)

In this example, there exists another relation between _Supplier_ and _technical requirements_.

_Collaboration_ is one of the few undirected relations.

### Provide

Provide is a relation existing between a role and a document, hardware, system or component.

For example, the _Supplier_ **provides** _technical requirements_ to the _Provider_. 

PROVIDE(Supplier, technical requirements)

### Comply with

_Comply with_ is a relation existing between an entity and a standard.

For example, the _technical specification_ **complies with** the _DO-178C_ norm.

COMPLY_WITH(technical specification, DO-178C)

### Composed by

_Composed by_ is a relation existing between two components, a system and its components, or hardware and one of its systems or components. 

For example, the _aircraft_ is **composed by** the _electro-mechanical actuator_ among other components.

COMPOSED_BY(aircraft, electro-mechanical actuator)

### Has feature

_Has feature_ is a relation existing between hardware, a system or a component and a parameter.

For example, the _sensor_ **has a** _temperature_ of 11째C.

HAS_FEATURE(sensor, temperature)

### Has value

_Has value_ is a relation existing between a parameter and a unit or condition, or a component, system or hardware and a condition.

For example, the sensor has a _temperature_ **of** _11째C_.

HAS_VALUE(temperature, 11째C)

Another example would be : 

The _door_ **is** _open_.

HAS_VALUE(door, open)

### Control

Control is a relation existing between components, systems or hardware.

For example, the _electro-hydraulic servo valves_ **control** the movement of the _actuators_.

CONTROL(electro-hydraylic servo valves, actuators)

### Connection

Connection is a relation existing between two components that are physically connected.
